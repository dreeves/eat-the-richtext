Eat The Richtext
================

See 
[my LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fFu4tZom8twYdEyeD/eat-the-richtext) 
for the backstory.

Short version: 
Type or paste text on the left or right side and watch it convert itself on the other side. 
It's pretty self-explanatory!

## Tables

You can paste tables into the richtext side and get a GitHub-flavored markdown version.
Or vice versa: Markdown on the right using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`) yields a richtext table on the left.

## Superscripts

There's no syntax for superscripts in markdown but html is always allowed in markdown so Eat The Richtext turns superscripts like x<sup>y</sup> into `x<sup>y</sup>`.

# Hosting

This is currently hosted on Replit but I intend to move it to GitHub Pages.
There's no backend, just browser localstorage.
